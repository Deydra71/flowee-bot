## *A Little Companion on your Journey of Faith*

Welcome to **FloweeBot**, a Bible Discord bot for everyone who wishes to turn their heart towards God. Originally created for the [Efisio Cross](https://www.youtube.com/@EfisioCross) Discord server, FloweeBot is designed to provide daily verses, prayer generation, and Bible Trivia to aid in your spiritual journey. 

### **:musical_note: Efisio Cross :musical_note:**

Efisio Cross is a talented artist who creates beautiful, heavenly music. Please take a moment to explore his work:
- Visit his [Website](https://efisiocross.com/)
- Listen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@EfisioCross)

### **Acknowledgments** :pray:

The creation of FloweeBot would not have been possible without the invaluable contributions of others:
- The Bible files used by FloweeBot are sourced from the [Bible: XML and JSON](https://github.com/thiagobodruk/bible) GitHub repository, which was generously created and shared by [thiagobodruk](https://github.com/thiagobodruk).
- The prayers used by FloweeBot are sourced from the [Crosswalk](https://www.crosswalk.com/) website. 

## *Work in Progress* 

Please note that FloweeBot is still being developed and improved upon. This is my first bot creation, hence only the source code is available (not the bot itself). If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contact me :heart:

## *TODO*
Create YAML/JSON file to be filled with user-individual variables, update source files accordingly
